## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: Maximale Anzahl der Verh√∂r-Iterationen - Wenn der Zeuge nach mehreren Fragen immer noch unvollst√§ndige Antworten liefert, wie soll das System reagieren? ‚Üí A: Konfigurierbares Limit (User w√§hlt 5-20 Iterationen vor Start)
- Q: Session-Speicherung - Sollen Benutzer vergangene Verh√∂r-Sessions speichern und sp√§ter wieder aufrufen k√∂nnen? ‚Üí A: Ja - Sessions automatisch speichern und Liste aller Sessions anzeigen zum Laden (√ºber Men√ºpunkt, nicht als Haupt-UI)
- Q: API Rate Limiting - Wenn eine Cloud-API ein Rate Limit erreicht, wie soll das System reagieren? ‚Üí A: Automatisch zum n√§chsten konfigurierten Cloud-Provider wechseln (Fallback) mit Dokumentation des Wechsels im Session-Audit-Trail
- Q: Gleichzeitige Sessions - Soll ein Benutzer mehrere Verh√∂r-Sessions parallel laufen lassen k√∂nnen? ‚Üí A: Nur eine aktive Session - Start-Button deaktiviert w√§hrend Verh√∂r l√§uft
- Q: API-Timeouts - Wie lange soll das System auf eine Antwort warten, bevor ein Timeout eintritt? ‚Üí A: Konfigurierbarer Timeout in Settings - Cloud-APIs: 15-120 Sekunden, Lokale LLMs: 15-360 Sekunden

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A user wants to get comprehensive, detailed answers from a local AI model that tends to give incomplete responses. They input a hypothesis or question into the Detective Agent Orchestrator application. The system uses a powerful cloud-based AI (the "detective") to systematically interrogate a local AI model (the "witness") by asking follow-up questions whenever gaps or inconsistencies are detected. The interrogation continues until the detective determines the answer is complete and consistent. Finally, the user receives a comprehensive report with the complete information, consistency score, and any identified contradictions or gaps.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the user has the application open and API credentials configured, **When** they enter the hypothesis "Summarize the health benefits of Vitamin B3" and start the interrogation, **Then** the system displays a live interrogation flow showing questions from the detective to the witness, answers from the witness, and continues until the detective determines the answer is complete.

2. **Given** an interrogation is running, **When** the witness provides an incomplete answer (e.g., missing dosage information), **Then** the detective automatically detects the gap and asks a follow-up question to fill that gap.

3. **Given** an interrogation has completed, **When** the user views the results, **Then** they see a consistency score (0-100), a list of all question-answer pairs, identified contradictions (if any), and a final comprehensive summary.

4. **Given** the user has not configured API credentials, **When** they try to start an interrogation, **Then** the system displays an error message indicating which API credentials are missing and prevents the interrogation from starting.

5. **Given** an API connection fails during interrogation, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the system displays a clear error notification, shows connection status as failed, and provides a retry option.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the configured iteration limit is reached but witness still provides incomplete information? System stops and presents current results with indication that limit was reached.
- How does the system handle extremely long responses from the witness that might exceed context windows?
- What happens if the user closes the application while an interrogation is running? Progress is lost for incomplete sessions; only completed sessions are saved.
- What if the local witness model is not running or unreachable?
- What if both detective and witness give contradictory answers across iterations?

  - Attributes: unique identifier, start time, end time, status (running/completed/failed/limit-reached), hypothesis reference, configured iteration limit, audit trail (provider switches)
  - Relationships: contains multiple QuestionAnswerPairs, produces one AuditResult

- **QuestionAnswerPair**: A single exchange between detective and witness
  - Attributes: sequence number, question text, answer text, timestamp, gap analysis results, detective provider used
  - Relationships: belongs to one InterrogationSession

- **AuditResult**: The final analysis of an interrogation session
  - Attributes: consistency score (0-100), list of contradictions, list of gaps, final summary text
  - Relationships: belongs to one InterrogationSession

- **Configuration**: User settings for API connections and preferences
  - Attributes: detective API credentials, witness connection settings, selected models, timeout settings (cloud: 15-120s, local: 15-360s), provider fallback order, iteration limit preference

  - Gap categories: missing_information, ambiguity, inconsistency, vagueness
  - Relationships: embedded in each QuestionAnswerPair, drives follow-up question generation
  - Note: If requiresFollowUp is true, detective generates next question; if false, interrogation can conclude
